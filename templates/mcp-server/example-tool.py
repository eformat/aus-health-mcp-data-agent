"""Example MCP tool demonstrating the enrichment pattern.

This tool returns PM2.5 air quality data from a fictional integration
with the EPA Air Quality System (AQS). The key pattern is that the tool
response includes not just the raw measurement data, but structured
metadata that feeds the agent's 6-step reasoning protocol.

Replace this with your own domain's data source and indicators.
