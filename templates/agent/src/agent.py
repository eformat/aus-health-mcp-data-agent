"""Domain-neutral data agent with structured reasoning protocol.

This agent extends BaseAgent with two post-processing layers:

1. A tool-call insistor that retries when the model produces an answer
   without calling any tools. The system prompt requires grounding in
   retrieved data, so a tool-free answer is always wrong.

2. A reasoning rubric injector that, after the tool-calling loop
   produces an answer, makes a second structured-output call to
   produce the 6-step reasoning rubric. The model's single-shot
   response often skips structured output; the second call is
   deterministic and prefix-cache-cheap.

The confidence card is built programmatically from the tool trace --
no LLM call needed. This makes confidence calibration reproducible.

NOTE: Model-specific workarounds (streaming parser fixes, chat template
quirks) would go in setup(). See the comments in that method.
